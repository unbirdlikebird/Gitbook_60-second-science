Quitting smoking is tough—so tough that only about [5 percent of smokers](http://www.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/professionals/clinicians-providers/guidelines-recommendations/tobacco/clinicians/update/treating_tobacco_use08.pdf) who try to quit in a given year actually succeed. Medications [can double those odds](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009329.pub2/abstract;jsessionid=0631D669ED7F9E029DEB9DF0AE479BEA.d04t03)—which still leaves a high failure rate. [And a promising vaccine](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-help-for-smokers/), meant to arouse an immune response to nicotine, [could not beat a placebo](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=100445&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1626882&highlight=) in clinical trials. But researchers haven't given up on a vaccine yet. Instead of revving up the immune system, though, they've come up with a new idea: why not use an enzyme to break down nicotine—before it gives you a buzz?

"For almost 50 years there's been reports of bacteria that can actually use nicotine to thrive on." Kim Janda, a chemist and immunologist at The Scripps Research Institute. "The bacteria uses nicotine as its sole source of carbon and nitrogen."

It does the trick with a nicotine-chomping enzyme. So Janda and his colleagues added the enzyme to mouse serum, doped with a cigarette's worth of nicotine. The enzyme was stable at human body temperature—and was able to cut the half-life of nicotine from a couple hours to less than 15 minutes—that is, it greatly accelerated nicotine’s disappearance. The study is in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. [Song Xue et al, [A New Strategy for Smoking Cessation: Characterization of a Bacterial Enzyme for the Degradation of Nicotine](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5b06605)]

But Janda says the enzyme isn't ready for primetime yet. It's bacterial—so "you're going to get an immune response, immune surveillance from it." And right now, the other important half-life, that of the enzyme in serum, is only 3 days. So it won’t stick around long enough to be an effective vaccine. "A month would be great, a week or two would also be reasonable." While the researchers work out the kinks, smokers will have to rely on the tried-and-true methods of quitting: counseling, medication or good old cold turkey.
